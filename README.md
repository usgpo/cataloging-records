# CGP on GitHub

## General Information

Metadata and Collection Services (MCS), formerly Library Technical Services (LTS), of Library Services & Content Management (LSCM), United States Government Publishing Office (GPO), develops and maintains this repository. The **CGP on GitHub** is a repository of cataloging/metadata resources extracted from the bibliographic records of the  [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov). The CGP is the U.S. Government Publishing Office's (GPO) finding tool for publications of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and other entities of the U.S. Federal Government. The CGP records comprise the [National Collection of U.S. Government Public Information](https://www.fdlp.gov/about-the-fdlp/the-national-collection) and contain descriptive and subject information to enable the discovery of these resources. Many CGP records provide PURL (persistent uniform resource locator) links to the online versions of publications. For more information, please visit the CGP [help pages](https://catalog.gpo.gov/cgphelp/en/help.html).
